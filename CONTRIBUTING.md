## Introduction

First thing first, I would like to thank you for considering this project. It's people like you that make it such a wonderful place.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

This is an open-source project and we love to receive contributions from our community; yes you! There are many ways to contribute, from sharing your python notes, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into the main project itself.

### Ask a question

We are using a [gitter channel][01] for support questions. But please be wary that maintaining an open-source project can take a lot of time from the maintainers. If asking for a support question, state it clearly and take the time to explain your problem properly. Also, if your problem is not strictly related to this project, we recommend you to use Stack Overflow instead.
